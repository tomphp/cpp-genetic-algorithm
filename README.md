Basic test of genetic algorithms
================================

This is a basic test of using genetic alogrithms to find a formula to calculate
a given number.

I created this as an exercise in C++ I've not use C++ much for a long time and
have recently been looking at what's not in C++11 so I thought I'd give it a
try.

Since this in an exercise C++11, should any wandering C++ expert happen to find
this and see things which could be done better then I'd be very greatful for
any suggestions you have to offer.

Issues
======

These are some issues I have noticed but not looked into yet.

* It often segfaults for target numbers greater than 100.
* Every now and then gets stuck in an infinite loop.

Things I want to try
====================

I think I'd like to have another go with a TDD approach and see what can be
done with Google Mock.
